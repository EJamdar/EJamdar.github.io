        <h2>Introduction</h2> 
        <p>For multiple yars, Pakistan has been seen as an ally to the war on terror due to being strategically being next to Afghanistan and due to Pakistan insisting that they are doing their best to combat terrorism. Ever since the start of the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, the United States had paretnered with Pakistan to fund the reistance in Afghanistan to fight the Soviets. The United Staes would fund the Mujahiden by providing them with money, train the Mujahideen (though the US would only help fund Pakistan with doing the trainings themselves) buying Chinese made AK-47's, RPG's and other misc. small arms to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. Pakistan was instructed to distribute the weapons and money equally between the Mujahidin groups. The weapons and money was to be distributed by Pakistani ISI (Pakistani Intellegence). At this time, Pakistan-US Relations were at it's best mostly because of the cooperation against the Soviets. And once the US invaded Afghanistan after 9/11, Pakistan was seen as a valuable ally to the west in order to make sure Taliban and Al-Qaidah members did not hide out in the Pakistani Tribal Areas after fleeing Afghanistan. Well this has been a lie. Pakistan was never an ally for the west and has been playing a double game with the west. During the Soviet war in Afghanistan, Pakistan used some money that was to be given to the Muajhids and used it to fight for their Kashmir war. Pakistan has been funding militant Islamic groups for it's interests in Afghanistan <a href="http://www.khaama.com/nabil-release-secret-docs-about-pakistans-support-to-afghan-militants-01488">(giving assistance to the Taliban and Haqqani Network)</a> and funding jihadist groups for their own interests.</p>
