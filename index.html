        <h2>Introduction</h2> 
        <p>For multiple decades, Apple has been the one company to take a concept that seems good on papaer and not executed well and change it up their way to be simple and be overall better. But there is a secret side to Apple that Apple does not want the public to see. This has been a secret that has been well hidden since 1997 but now I will expose Apple for its Illuminati secrets that it has been keeping secret.</p>
        <h2>How did the Illuminati Get Control of Apple</h2>
        <img src="wozniak.jpg" alt="Smiley face" height="720px" width="960x">
        <h2 style = "color:green;"> As we all know, Apple was founded by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak from Job's garage after geting engaged with computers from their local computer clud. The Apple I did not see much sucess but with the release of the Apple II, Apple sold a lot of units of the Apple II and this skyrocketed Apples success. Apple would launch more computers during this time such as more variations of the Apple II, Apple Lisa and of course the famous Macintosh line of computers which was one of the earliest computers to launch with a GUI. But around this time, Steve Jobs was having problems with the company such as the company getting mad everytime Steve would get mad over a really simple mistake when it came to the design of everything due to him being a profectionist. To make a long story short, the leadership of Apple booted Steve from the company and Steve Jobs would go on to do his own things. From 1985 to 1997, Steve would try to launch his own line of computers known as the NEXT computers which was a failiure and he would also kickstart the animation company known as PIXAR. But this was just simple backstory to misguide the American people into beliving Steve was fine. But in reality it was a backstory created by the Illuminati.</h2>
